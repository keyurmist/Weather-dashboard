# Weather-dashboard

For this project we were tasked to create a weather dashboard. It had to show a 5 day forecast for the current city amongst many other things. It had to use local storage and also call from that local storage to display past searches.

Tools used in the making of this:

- HTML
- CSS/ Bulma
- Javascript
- JQuery
- Moment.js
